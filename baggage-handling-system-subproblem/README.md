## The Problem

To get from check-in to airplane, baggage travels over a large system of conveyors. The bags are taken through security screening, then must be routed to the correct terminal to be loaded onto the plane. (add more details). To get the bag to the correct terminal, the conveyor system needs to know where the bag needs to end up, to track where it is, and to move it onto the correct conveyors. It does this for thousands of bags, all at the same time.
In addition to routing the bags, the conveyor system needs to have methods to detect foreign objects or people entering the conveyor system, to keep the people safe.

## The Challenge

Your challenge is to design a BHS that can identify, track, route baggage through a simplified baggage handling environment, and detect anomalies or foreign objects on conveyor systems to ensure operational safety.

## Potential Solutions

The ideas below are examples to help teams explore possible directions. They are not the only possible solutions.

Teams are encouraged to combine ideas, explore new approaches, and develop creative solutions. 

| Potential solution | Description | Resources |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Conveyor control [Supported] | Focuses on physical hardware and edge-computing setups centered on camera-driven barcode tracking, diverter actuation timing, and real-time scanner/routing logging. | ADD LINK |
| Error handling | Error handling for unreadable, oversized, overweight, fragile, or untagged bags | 
| Detection | Foreign object or anomaly detection on conveyor tracks |
| Operator signaling | Emergency stop, slowdown, or warning signals for conveyor operations | 
| Simulation | Simulation of bag movement through a simplified conveyor network |

Your solution may be software-only, hardware-assisted, simulation-based or a combination. 

It is suggested to use the physical conveyor setup for this subproblem, although not necessary. Resources are provided to help you use the conveyor setup. Additional hardware can be borrowed from the IDEAs Clinic. You may also use the code provided for other subproblems, if you find it useful.
